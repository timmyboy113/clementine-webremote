With this remote for Clementine player you can control your Clementine Music player from your smartphone, tablet or desktop computer through a web browser.

You can view the track, album, artist names, complete tracklist and saved playlist-files in a specific folder. You also have normal mediaplayer controls (pause, next, etc), volume control, repeat/shuffle and you can select which track to play from the tracklist as well as open playlist-files (m3u-files).

clementine-webremote is a Python script that creates a simple http server listening a specified port (by default 3000, but you can change it).

v0.3 was developed mainly with desktop use in mind, but it works fairly well on a 2.55" Android phone as well (as opposed to the more common 3.5"-5"). v0.3 has been tested on a Sony Ericsson Xperia x10 Mini Pro. v0.2 has been tested on SGS and HTC Desire.

I only tried it with an Android phone (SGS and HTC Desire), but theorically must work on any device with a web browser.
